#Project Funding app

We are a group of students building a project funding app. This app will allow start ups solicit funds and angel investors will have the opportunity to scout for ideas to invest in. This project connects to the first SDG goal which is No poverty since it will help in creating jobs and also aligns with SDG 17 which has to do with the need to mobilize financial  resources for  developing countries from international sources since our investors would be from across the globe.
